# illumio_coding_excercise
Contains coding challenge

# Testing
My test strategy was to cover the corner case and make sure it will work for the case when there was a range in the port and also the ipAddress. I ran tests on the given input as well.

# Implementation
The main class with a constructor that takes in a file path for the input rules. It reads the CSV file line by line and creates a rule and is then added to the "networkruleforrange" HashSet.
I overrode the equals methods such that two network rules are similar when direction, protocol, port and IP address are same

# Refinements
If time had permit, I would have added validations to all the input field

# Teams
While each Team sounds interesting to work on, I would like to work in Policy team and my next prefereance would be Data Team
